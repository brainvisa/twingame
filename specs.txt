Twins game GUI
==============

1 window
left panel: buttons
right space: 3D views
menu: settings
usable without a mouse on a touch screen

each view has a colored handle used to associate or move views

zoom ? the global brain shape maybe makes the game too easy ?
-> do not display individual meshes, but an average one instead ?

actions:
- start / reset
- move a view to place it next to another
- associate pair: check 2 buttons and click "associate"
- dissociate a pair (rrevert association)
- see the solution solution, diffs with the player guesses
- sync views
- show subjects with solution
- sort subjects ?

- reset zoom, points of view ?

settings:
- number of visible pairs
- hemisphere
- associate hemispheres ?

dataset:
.json config file as input
